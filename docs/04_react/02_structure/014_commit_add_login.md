# Summary of Updates

## 1. Added Login Page (`login.form.tsx`)

- Created a new file named `login.form.tsx` within the 'auth' folder.
- Implemented the `Login` component in this file.

## 2. Updated App Guard (`app.guard.tsx`)

- Enhanced the `Guard` component with an `isAuthenticated` boolean.
- Used `useEffect` to check authentication status (`!isAuthenticated`) and redirect to '/login' if necessary.
- Added a cleanup function within `useEffect` for potential cleanup.

These changes establish a foundational structure for guarding routes based on authentication and introduce initial components required for authentication, including the `Login` page. Further adjustments will be needed for a complete authentication implementation, such as integrating a session management system in the store.
