# Run Your React App:

Open your terminal.

Navigate to the root of your React project:

```bash
cd path/to/your/react/project
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will compile your React app and open it in your default web browser.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in the console).

You should see your React app running with the changes you've made.

Make additional changes in your code, save the files, and observe the live updates in the browser. The development server automatically reloads the app when changes are detected.

Now, you can actively develop and view changes in your React app as you make modifications to the code. If you have set up routing or added components, navigate through different pages or components to ensure everything is working as expected.
