# Using the useSelector Hook

1. **Import the Hook:**
   In any React component where you want to access Redux state, import the `useSelector` hook from `react-redux`.

```typescript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
```

## Select State

Inside your component, invoke the useSelector hook and pass in a selector function to select the desired state from the Redux store.

```typescript
const isAuthenticated = useSelector(
  (state: RootState) => state.session.isAuthenticated
);
```

## Access State

You can now use the isAuthenticated variable to access the selected state value within your component.

```typescript
console.log(isAuthenticated);
```

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the useSelector hook in a React functional component:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { AppState } from '../stores';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const isAuthenticated = useSelector(
    (state: AppState) => state.session.isAuthenticated
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <p>User is authenticated: {isAuthenticated ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we import the useSelector hook and use it to select the `isAuthenticated` state from the Redux store. We then display the value of `isAuthenticated` within the component.
