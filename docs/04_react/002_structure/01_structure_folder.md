# Create React App Folder Structure

1. **Navigate to Your React Project Directory:**

   - Open your terminal.
   - Change to your React project directory using the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/react/project
     ```

2. **Navigate to the 'src' Directory:**

   - Change to the 'src' directory:
     ```bash
     cd src
     ```

3. **Create the Specified Folder Structure:**

   - Create the folders for assets, components, store, hooks, contexts, helpers, and pages using the `mkdir` command:
     ```bash
     mkdir assets components store hooks contexts helpers pages
     ```

4. **Confirm Folder Creation:**

   - Confirm that the folders have been successfully created by listing the contents of the 'src' directory:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Review the created folder structure and adjust as needed based on your specific project requirements.

Your React app now has a structured 'src' directory with organized folders for assets, components, state management, hooks, contexts, helpers, and pages. Adjust this structure according to your project's architecture and organization preferences.

This set of commands will create the following folder structure within your React app's 'src' directory:

assets/: For storing static assets like images, fonts, etc.
components/: To house reusable React components.
store/: For managing state using state management libraries like Redux.
hooks/: For custom React hooks.
contexts/: For React context providers.
helpers/: To store utility/helper functions.
pages/: For React components that represent different pages/routes of your application.

```plaintext
src/
|-- assets/
|-- components/
|-- store/
|-- hooks/
|-- contexts/
|-- pages/
```

Adjust this structure based on your specific project needs and feel free to add subfolders or further organize the contents within each directory.
