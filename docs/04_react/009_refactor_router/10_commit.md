# Project Refactoring Summary

## 1. **Routing Refinement:**

- Consolidated all routes directly into `app.router.tsx`.
- Removed the `DashboardRoute` and `AuthRoute` components for a more streamlined approach.

## 2. **Module-Specific Routes:**

- Organized routes for the Dashboard and Auth modules directly in the main router.
- Improved code organization and maintainability.

## 3. **AuthGuard Implementation:**

- Renamed the `Guard` component to `AuthGuard` for clarity.
- Implemented the `AuthGuard` to control access to Auth-related routes based on authentication status.

## 4. **WebPage Module Handling:**

- Introduced a wildcard route (`*`) in `app.router.tsx` to handle unspecified paths under the WebPage module.
- Ensured the rendering of the WebPage component for unmatched routes, providing a catch-all mechanism for generic website content.

## 5. **Code Readability and Naming:**

- Ensured clear and descriptive component naming for improved code readability.
- Streamlined code structure to enhance understanding and simplify future modifications.

## 6. **Overall Benefits:**

- Improved project structure and organization.
- Enhanced security with the implementation of the `AuthGuard`.
- Simplified routing logic for better maintainability.
- Consistent and scalable structure to accommodate project growth.
