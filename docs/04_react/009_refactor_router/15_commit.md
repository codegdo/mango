# Summary of Recent Updates

- Integrated `app.router.tsx` to wrap the entire application, serving as the entry point for routing.
- Updated the project structure to reflect the new organization:
  - Introduced `app.component.tsx` as the main component rendered by the router.
  - Added `app.guard.tsx` for authentication and authorization guards.
  - Defined `app.layout.tsx` for layout components used across the application.
  - Organized components under the `pages` directory, including subdirectories for different sections such as dashboard and authentication.
  - Introduced standalone components for error handling (`page.error.tsx`), not found pages (`page.notfound.tsx`), and webpage display (`page.webpage.tsx`).
  - Added a welcome page (`dashboard.welcome.tsx`) within the dashboard section.

This restructuring enhances clarity and maintainability, ensuring smoother navigation and management of components within the application.

## Additional Changes in `main.tsx`

Replaced `app.component` with `app.router` to integrate the routing system.
