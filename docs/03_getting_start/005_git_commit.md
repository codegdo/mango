After initializing npm, stage the changes for Git:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit the changes with a meaningful message:

```bash
git commit -m "Initialize react application"
```

Push the changes to your remote repository (assuming you have already set up a remote repository on a platform like GitHub):

```bash
git push
```

These steps assume that you have Git configured and have set up a remote repository. If you haven't set up a remote repository, you can follow the instructions on platforms like GitHub to create one before pushing the changes.
