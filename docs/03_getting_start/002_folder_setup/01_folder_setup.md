# Project Folder Structure

We've organized our project into root folders named "aws," "apps" with subfolders, and "docs." If you have specific tasks or goals related to these folders, providing more details will allow us to offer tailored instructions. Nevertheless, here are some generic instructions based on the provided folder structure:

## 1. AWS Folder:

The "aws" folder appears to be at the root level. If this folder is meant to contain configurations, scripts, or resources related to Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can organize it further:

```plaintext
aws/
|-- configurations/
|-- scripts/
|-- resources/
|-- ...
```

configurations/: Store AWS configuration files.
scripts/: Keep any scripts related to AWS tasks.
resources/: Include any additional resources.

## 2. Apps Folder:

The "apps" folder seems to contain two subfolders: "nest", "next", "react." Assuming these are separate applications:

```plaintext
apps/
|-- nest/
|   |-- src/
|   |-- tests/
|   |-- ...
|-- next/
|   |-- src/
|   |-- tests/
|   |-- ...
|-- react/
|   |-- src/
|   |-- tests/
|   |-- ...
|-- ...
```

nest/: Nest application files.
src/: Source code.
tests/: Test files.
Additional folders as needed.

next/: Next application files.
src/: Source code.
tests/: Test files.
Additional folders as needed.

react/: React application files.
src/: Source code.
tests/: Test files.
Additional folders as needed.
Additional applications can be added similarly.

## 3. Docs Folder:

The "docs" folder for documentation:

Certainly! If you want to include a "docs" folder in your structure for documentation, you can add it like this:

```plaintext
aws/
|-- configs/
|-- scripts/
|-- resources/
|-- ...
apps/
|-- nest/
|   |-- src/
|   |-- tests/
|   |-- ...
|-- next/
|   |-- src/
|   |-- tests/
|   |-- ...
|-- react/
|   |-- src/
|   |-- tests/
|   |-- ...
|-- ...
docs/
|-- nest/
|   |-- README.md
-- next/
|   |-- README.md
|-- react/
|   |-- README.md
|-- ...
```

Here:

docs/: Contains documentation for different applications or services.
nest/: Documentation for the first application.
README.md: Overview of the application.
design.md: Design documentation.
react/: Documentation for the second application.
README.md: Overview of the application.
design.md: Design documentation.

### General Recommendations:

If these folders represent different projects or services, consider having a README file in each folder providing an overview and instructions for that specific project.
Keep related files and folders together to make it easier to navigate and understand the project structure.
Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with others effectively.
Feel free to provide more specific details about what you're looking to achieve or any specific tasks you need assistance with related to this folder structure.
