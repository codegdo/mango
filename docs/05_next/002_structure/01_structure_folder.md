# Create Next App Folder Structure

### public/

This folder is used to store static assets such as images, fonts, or any other files that you want to serve directly to the client without processing.

### src/

This folder contains the source code of your Next.js application. It's the main folder where you'll be working on your React components, pages, utilities, etc.

- **app/**: This directory is dedicated to app routing logic.
- **components/**: Contains reusable React components used across different parts of the application.

- **helpers/**: Holds utility functions or helper modules providing common functionalities or performing specific tasks.

- **hooks/**: Contains custom React hooks, allowing you to extract component logic into reusable functions.

- **contexts/**: Contains React context providers and consumers for managing global state.

- **services/**: Holds modules responsible for interacting with external services or APIs.

- **store/**: Contains files related to state management solutions like Redux or MobX.

- **utils/**: Contains various utility functions or helper modules providing common functionalities or performing specific tasks.

This folder structure helps organize the codebase efficiently, making it easier to navigate and maintain as the project grows.
